        <p>
          I'm a Front-End Developer with a passion for creating responsive, user-friendly web interfaces.
          Currently expanding my skills in back-end development to become a full-stack contributor.
          I'm a strong team player with a quick learning ability and a solid grasp of modern web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also deeply interested in game development, especially using engines like Unity and Unreal.
          I enjoy combining creativity with code to bring interactive and immersive experiences to life.
          Whether it's crafting sleek websites or building game prototypes, I'm always eager to innovate.
        </p>

          I'm seeking opportunities to grow in collaborative and forward-thinking environments.
